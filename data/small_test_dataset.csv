11,"<p>My project launches a target process, injecting a library into it which is meant to hook Direct3D functions. I have done this successfully in the past, but decided to rewrite the library to a closer specification of the Direct3D interfaces. The idea here was to create a set of my own 1:1 wrapper classes, each inheriting a DirectX interface (ie, <code>class CD3D8 : IDirect3D8</code>, <code>class CD3DDevice8 : IDirect3DDevice8</code> and so forth). Since all members of each underlying DirectX COM interface are pure virtual methods, I thought I could easily override them...</p>

<p>So when my library hooks <code>Direct3DCreate8</code>, I return a pointer to my <code>CDirect3D8</code> instead of the standard <code>IDirect3D8</code>. And then my library uses the virtual table of that pointer to hook method #15, which is <code>IDirect3D8::CreateDevice</code>. And once that is called, I return a pointer to <code>CDirect3DDevice8</code> as opposed to <code>IDirect3DDevice8</code>. All appears to be well, except none of the overrided functions are being called by the injected application! Somehow, the app appears to be calling the original interface functions instead of my own. Am I missing some sort of concept here? Do I need to manually remap the virtual table pointers to the ones in my custom wrapper classes, for example?</p>

... The hooked functions get called, but none of my wrapper functions do, and the injected application runs just as it normally would. Why is this? Of course, I could manually set hooks for each and every function found in each and every DirectX interface (for each version of Direct3D), but the point of this was to try and prevent having to do that and to keep it a bit cleaner. So is there a way to get this to work as I had intended? Thanks!</p>

17,"<p>So, I'd like to change the layout of the keyboard inside my app, such that it will include a next button(which would switch between text fields, similar to the tab key on a normal keyboard) and done button (to dismiss the keyboard altogether).Another thing I'd like to change would be to make the keyboard bring up the numpad instead of the usual layout when you choose certain text fields (which are meant to accept numbers only).

I'm an experienced programmer (PHP, C#, javascript, and some C most recently), and I find the python manual pretty lacking compared the PHP manual and MSDN.

<p>HTML is good, css probely not and i'm almost sure that the jquery is good.
Can someone check this for me and correct my mistakes?</p>

<p>On the top i've a logo on the left side and menu has to be on the right side.
The menu has in the correct html an width of 1200px and is margin:0 auto;.
But the logo is on the same height as the menu so that's why i've put #menu ul float:right;.</p>

89,"<p>What I've read and know about sessions is that they aren't really reliable with all that session id hijacking and stuff. So I decided I won't use sessions in my project, I'd rather just go with ordinary cookies and hope for the best.</p>

<p>So basically what I have set up is kind of like a session but hopefully will be harder to crack. Unfortunately I seem to be unable to build it hard-to-crack. So basically I guess this is more of a security question rather than the choice between cookies or sessions, but I cannot seem to find this in any straight text.</p>

<p>What am I supposed to hash in the session cookie and how? I've read that hashing algorithms can collide and it's just a matter of seconds before an attacker can create a string that would collide, with what is actually in the cookie, when hashed even though it may not be the same. I guess what I'm trying to ask is what is the proper way of saving this information in a cookie and actually what information should I store there?</p>

<p>I know that basically with <code>httpOnly</code> no attacker should be able to grab a hold of a cookie but I suppose that this project may and probably wont use <code>SSL</code> so there's the old tapping method available.
